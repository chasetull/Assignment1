The program starts out asking the user to insert the path of a dna file. Then will compute probability of the nucleotides 'A' 'G' 'T' 'C' and their respective bigrams. then it finds the variance, mean, sum, and standard deviation of the string lengths and prints everything to the file chaseTullar.txt

I had trouble trying to create the Gaussian distribution with the string lengths and finding the variance. I was unable to ask the user to process another file because the other program components took too long for me.

I used Stack Overflow, the C++ API, my roommate James Kistner and these websites to help me:
