Assignment2 - GOL

The program begins asking the user if they want to chose their game board
or have one read from a file. Then the user can define the size and amount of 'x's of the random
array if they chose that. The initial generation is then computed.

I couldn't figure out how to check the neighbors of the surrounding points on the grid.
I had trouble at first reading in the file. I also couldn't compute future generations.
I attempted to include all parts of the assignment but was unfortunately unable to
comprehend them in time.

I used Stack Overflow, the C++ API, my friend Marcus Hyun and these websites to help me:
