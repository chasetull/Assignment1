The program begins asking the user for the file path to compare the delimeters of the file. Then it iterates through each line read in and determins if there are any unmatched pairs ()/[]/{}. If there are unmatched pairs the program stops and informs the user. If the syntax checks out it prints the success to the user.

I couldn't figure out how to ask the user for another file to be read in. My program can only take the file I provided to work with the program. I started off having trouble with generic class implementation but I worked through it. The program can only tell you what line number the error is located in if the end of the file hasn't been reached.

I used Stack Overflow and these websites to help me:
